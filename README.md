# 3CComputersWebsite

This is my first project for a client!

Based in the West-Midlands, 3CComputers is a company specialising in repairing, upgrading and building custom computers. I reached out to them and offered to build them a website and they agreed.

The website consists of 6 pages including a home page, services page, contact page and a page for each of the services to show more information. 

The website is built using HTML, CSS and a small amount of JavaScript. I will hopefully be adding to this in the future.
